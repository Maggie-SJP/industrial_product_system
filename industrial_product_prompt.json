Return one object per product.\n- Common product model examples include: \"IMC-21GA\", \"EDS-G512E-8POE-4GSFP-T\", \"NPort 5110\", \"MGate MB3180\", etc.\n- If a quote number appears, often in the email subject (e.g., \"5298366 - WA\"), extract it and include it in a field called \"Quote_Number\" for each item.\n\nHere is the order content to process:\n===\n{combinedText}\n==="
